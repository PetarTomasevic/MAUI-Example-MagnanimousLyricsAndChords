[Verse 1]
 
Bm      G          A         Bm
Take me now, baby, here as I am.
Bm      G             A      Bm
Pull me close try and understand.
Bm        G              A      Bm
Desire is hunger, is the fire I breathe.
Bm        G          A         Bm
Love is a banquet on which we feed.
 
G       A            D    A
Come on now, try and understand
    Bm    G                     A
the way I feel when I'm in your hand.
D       G                A
Take my hand; come under cover.
     C                   Bm                  
They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, 
 F#
can't hurt you now.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Bm      G                 A     Bm
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Bm      G                 A  Bm
Because the night belongs to lust.
Bm      G                 A     Bm
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Bm      G                 A  Bm
Because the night belongs to us.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Bm     G     A         Bm
Have I doubt when I'm alone?
Bm        G           A     Bm
Love is a ring on the telephone.
Bm         G        A         Bm
Love is an angel disguised as lust,
Bm          G             A        Bm
here in our bed until the morning comes.
 
G       A            D    A
Come on now, try and understand
    Bm    G                  A
the way I feel under your command.
D       G                  A
Take my hand as the sun descends.
     C                    Bm                   
They can't touch you now, can't 
                F#
touch you now, can't touch you now.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Bm      G                 A     Bm
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Bm      G                 A  Bm
Because the night belongs to lust.
Bm      G                 A     Bm
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Bm      G                 A  Bm
Because the night belongs to us.

[Bridge]
 
     D    A                D         
With love we sleep; with doubt 
    A                  Bm   A
the vicious circle turns and burns.
D       A           Bm    A     D        A
Without you I cannot live, forgive 
       A
the yearning burning.
    G     D         G
I believe it's time, too real to feel.
   Bm            D             G          F#
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now.

Because the night belongs to lust.
Bm      G                 A     Bm
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Bm      G                 A  Bm
Because the night belongs to us.
 
Bm      G                 A      Bm
Because tonight there are two lovers.
Bm    G                    A  Bm
If we believe in the night we trust
Bm      G                 A     Bm
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Bm      G                 A Bm
