Deep Purple - Soldier of Fortune
(Blackmore/Coverdale)
"Stormbringer" (1974)
 
[Intro]
Gm   Dm   C  Gm
 
[Verse]
        Gm
I have often told you stories
F
About the way
   Gm
I lived the life of a drifter
Dm
  waiting for the day
          Gm
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
      F
Then maybe you would say
Gm
Come lay with me and love me
Dm
  And I would surely stay
 
[Chorus]
Bb       C                Gm
  But I feel I'm growing older
Eb          F                Bb
And the songs that I have sung
 D            Gm
Echo in the distance
           F
Like the sound
      Bb              Eb
Of a windmill going round
Cm                Dm
Guess I'll always be
              Gm
A soldier of fortune.
 
[Solo]
Gm   C   Gm   C
Gm   Bb   C   Gm
 
[Verse]
      Gm
Many times I've been a traveller
    F
I looked for something new
            Gm
In days of old when nights were cold
Dm
   I wandered without you
Gm
But those days I thought my eyes
F
Had seen you standing near
Gm
Though blindness is confusing
Dm
It shows that you're not here.
 
[Chorus]
Bb       C                Gm
  But I feel I'm growing older
Eb          F                Bb
And the songs that I have sung
 D            Gm
Echo in the distance
           F
Like the sound
      Bb              Eb
Of a windmill going round
Cm                Dm
Guess I'll always be
              Gm
A soldier of fortune.
 
     Gm             F
Yes, I can hear the sound
       Bb           Eb
of a windmill going round
   Cm               Dm
I guess I'll always be
              Gm
a soldier of fortune.
   Eb               Dm7
I guess I'll always be
              G
a soldier of fortune.
