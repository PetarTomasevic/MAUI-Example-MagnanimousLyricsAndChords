Wonderful Tonight

[Verse 1]
G                  D/F#    C                       D
  It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear.
G                 D/F#    C                D
  She puts on her make-up, and brushes her long blonde hair.
C               D     G      D/F#     Em
  And then she asks me "Do I look all right?"
            C             D            G
And I say "Yes, you look wonderful tonight!"
 
[Verse 2]
G            D/F#  C              D
  We'd go to party, and everyone turns to see
G                D/F# C                 D
  This beautiful lady, that's walking around with me.
C              D       G        D/F#          Em
  And then she asks me: "Do you feel all right?"
             C           D           G
And I say: "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight!"
 
[Bridge]
        C           D               G        D/F#      Em
I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes,
         C            D               C             D
And the wonder of it all is that you just don't realise,
            G
How much I love you!
 
[Verse 3]
G                 D/F#     C                D
  It's time to go home now, and I've got an aching head
G                   D/F#      C         D
  So I give her the car keys, and she helps me to bed.
C            D        G     D/F#         Em
  And then I tell her, as I turn off the light:
           C                 D           G      D/F#     Em
I say: "My darling, you were wonderful tonight!
  D/F#          Em       C                 D           G
                   Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight."
